You can register your account once you have at least one line of input by using:
register <password>

Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2_SHA256 and a randomize (non-predictable) iteration count.

Once you are registered, authenticate with:
authenticate <password>

You will lose your authentication if you change your nick.

You can test markov generation with:
markov

Or see "help markov"
