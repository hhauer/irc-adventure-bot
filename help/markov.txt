Markov chains are a methodology for generating text. A source model is fed to the markov
chain generator and reduced to a mapping table of "previous three characters" and 
"probable next character." A random selection across a probablistic distribution allows
the generator to piece chains together until either no next character is available or
a reasonable length limit is reached.
